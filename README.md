Docker-powered E-Commerce Website.

- avtobaza.az This is front of website
- api.avtobaza.net This is back of website (Swagger)
- ✨Magic ✨


## Tech

Auto Base uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [DRF] - Core project is writen in Drf!
- [@kerim] - My Linkedin account :)
- [Docker] - docker helps to create container that contain database, project, celery
- [Nginx] - helps to create bridge server
- [DigitalOcean] - host company that project deployed there
- [Celery] - for background tasks

And of Avtobaza itself is open source with a [private repository][dill]
 on GitHub.
